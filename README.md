# Magic-Mart
This is the prototype for a single-page shopping interface for a fictional fantasy store called "Mystic Mart." It is coded in simple, foundational HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a focus on straightforward state management and direct DOM manipulation; thus, it's perfect for beginners.

The goal is to illustrate some interactive web behaviors - hover effects, dynamic cart updates, and conditional logic related to inventory and couponing - using the most fundamental web technologies.
